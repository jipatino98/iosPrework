## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Since I do not have much experience with iOS development, it took some extra time to find the tools and menus Xcode offers.
I looked up on Stack Overflow how to insert local images into an ImageView object, which the solution was fairly straightforward.
I also had to look up how to change the text of a button programmatically, which I also found on StackOverflow.
